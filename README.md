IOS Socks Proxy with Background Audio for Background Operation

There are many iOS Socks Proxy apps on google code etc. This is one of those but one problem with many of them is that they only work when the app is in the foreground. Adding a Background Audio Plist item and using audio keeps the app running when the screen is off or the app is not in the foreground.
